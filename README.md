# Bike Yolo: A seamless implementation of YoloV8 providing SoTA bike detection
This repository is a comprehensive open-source project that demonstrates the integration of object detection using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm to detect bicycles using Roboflow's inference. This project provides a user-friendly and customizable interface that can detect bicycles in pictures and annotates them with Supervşsşon's BoxAnnotator
